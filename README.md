## Campus to Capital

Our team created Campus to Capital (C2C), an AI-powered interactive game designed to teach financial literacy through real-life scenarios. The concept? Players navigate connected “choose your own adventure” scenarios to learn the fundamentals of financial decision-making. Every playthrough is unique, thanks to AI, making the experience fun, personalised, and endlessly engaging. To build **C2C**, we used **NextJS/React **and **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek and responsive front-end and Python with **Flask** to power the backend, with **Open AI** integrations.
