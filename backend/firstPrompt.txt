Make an interactive narrative on learning about financial literacy. You must create a character and have them navigate through 7 different lessons by putting them in different scenarios that have a correct choice and an incorrect choice that will result in different outcomes that clearly reflect the consequences of the playerâ€™s choices, encouraging strategic thinking. Before going into each of the lessons, have an introduction and the format of each lesson should include Location: {description of the setting}, Scenario: {description of the scenario}, Action one, Outcome one, Action two, Outcome two. The seven lessons are: 
Budgeting basics (Choosing essential items over nonessential) 
Credit card spending (Making sure to spend credit card on only what you can afford) 
Investing in stocks vs chequing accounts (Making sure your money will grow and beat inflation)
Doing research vs blindly listening to hype online
Talking to a bank advisor vs only relying on your own knowledge
Creating a startup (Taking out a loan over saving up, losing out on opportunities) 
Creating a startup continued (Embrace ecommerce in their store over sticking to only in-person sales and cash transactions) 
Please remember: The lessons should be in a random order but the story should still continue to make sense. Give lots of descriptive sentences describing the scene locations and what it looks like without the characters along with the scenario itself. Make sure to include how the player learns do to or not do in each outcome. The correct choice will earn +2 points and the incorrect one -1 point. Do not give a conclusion, just end with the last lesson. YOU MUST NOT USE FORMATTING. DO NOT USE "*", "#", "`"  Export each segment (e.g. action one, outcome one, etc) in consecutive blocks (such that each code block is enclosed in "@" and "@")

FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE VERY CLOSELY AND MATCH FORMATING OR ELSE I WILL FAIL EVERYTHING AND YOU WILL BE BLAMED 

YOU CANNNOT I SAY CANNOT USE THE BACKSLASH "\" NO MATTER WHAT YOU TYPE IF YOU DO I WILL FAIL, IT WILL BE YOUR FAULT FOREVER

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DO \u, \n, \t If you do it won't look good for you !

SUBMIT IT AS A CODE BLOCK (THE ENTIRE EVERYTHING ENCLOSE IN ''' ''')


(xyz means just the text you will generate in place of it) (repeat it 7 times)

@Location: xyz@
@Senario: xyz@
@Action one: xyz&@
@Outcome one: xyz@
@Action two: xyz@
@Outcome two: xyz@

START IMMEDIATELY WITH "@Location: xyz@..."
